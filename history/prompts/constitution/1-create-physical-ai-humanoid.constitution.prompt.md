## Prompt
\n
A user asked for guidance on establishing a constitution for the "Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook" project. The project includes:Building a textbook site using Docusaurus and publishing it through GitHub Pages 2) Applying Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code to carry out AI-assisted, specification-driven development 3)Creating learning materials focused on humanoid robotics. The user later requested that the /sp.constitution command be executed to generate the constitution file.
\n
## Response snapshot
\n
Created the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific principles including Educational Excellence, Specification-Driven Development, Docusaurus-Based Documentation, AI-Assisted Development, Open Source and Accessibility, and Technical Accuracy and Verification. The constitution establishes content standards, development workflow using Spec-Kit Plus methodology, and governance rules for the project.
\n
## Outcome
\n
- ✅ Impact: Created project constitution file with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan and implement textbook content following constitution principles
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully established foundational principles for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project
