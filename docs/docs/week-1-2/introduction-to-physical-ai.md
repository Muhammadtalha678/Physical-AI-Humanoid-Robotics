# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to systems that understand and interact with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that processes abstract data, Physical AI systems must reason about physical laws, dynamics, and real-world constraints.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is the field of artificial intelligence focused on creating systems that understand and interact with the physical world. These systems must:
- Understand physical laws and constraints
- Reason about dynamics and motion
- Integrate perception and action
- Handle uncertainty in physical environments

## Key Concepts

### Embodied Intelligence
Embodied intelligence suggests that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Rather than processing abstract symbols, embodied systems learn from physical interactions.

### Physics Understanding
Physical AI systems must understand:
- Newtonian mechanics
- Kinematics and dynamics
- Material properties
- Force interactions
- Energy conservation

### Sensorimotor Integration
Physical AI requires tight integration between sensing and acting, where perception informs action and action enables better perception.

## Applications

Physical AI has applications in:
- Humanoid robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial automation
- Assistive robotics
- Space exploration
- Surgical robotics

## Challenges

Developing Physical AI systems presents unique challenges:
- Real-time processing requirements
- Uncertainty in sensing and actuation
- Complex physics simulation
- Safety and reliability requirements
- Hardware constraints

## Learning Objectives
