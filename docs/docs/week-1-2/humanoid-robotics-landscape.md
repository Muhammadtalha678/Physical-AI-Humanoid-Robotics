# Overview of Humanoid Robotics Landscape

Humanoid robotics represents one of the most challenging and ambitious areas in robotics, requiring the integration of multiple complex technologies to create robots that resemble and behave like humans.

## Definition and Characteristics

Humanoid robots are robots with human-like characteristics, including:
- **Bipedal locomotion**: Two-legged walking similar to human gait
- **Human-like manipulation**: Arms and hands capable of human-like dexterity
- **Human-like interaction**: Ability to interact naturally with humans and human environments
- **Anthropomorphic design**: Body structure that resembles human proportions

## Historical Development

### Early Humanoid Robots
- **WABOT-1 (1973)**: First full-scale humanoid robot developed at Waseda University
- **Honda P Series (1980s-1990s)**: Early bipedal walking robots
- **ASIMO (2000)**: Advanced humanoid with autonomous capabilities

### Modern Developments
- **Boston Dynamics Atlas**: High-performance humanoid with dynamic movement
